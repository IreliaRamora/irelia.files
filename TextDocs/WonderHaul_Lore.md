# Lore Ideas for WonderHaul Items

This list compiles a bunch of different ideas for how the lore for WonderHaul items will be implemented.

## General Lore

If possible, we may want to identify all WonderHaul items in order to differentiate them from the regular MC items. Evidently, it will be easy to tell what items are WonderHaul based on the lore we decide to add, as regular items don't implement lore usually. However, adding a tag to identify the items may be useful for grabbing items in the future.

These items can be added in preferrably the top or bottom of the lore list, but might be easier to have at the top so you have a constant location that's easy to access. 

May also consider a dark grey coloring if you don't want it to be noticeable. Or, we could add a clause into the lore tag skript to ignore the WH when writing to the item. This is up for debate. 

### Ideas:
* WH 
* WonderHaul
* WonderHaul Item

In addition, all WonderHaul items will have their Item type and Tier listed at the top of the lore, just like in the examples provided on [the WonderHaul main page](https://winterbear.github.io/Legioncraft-Wiki/wonderhaul.html).
